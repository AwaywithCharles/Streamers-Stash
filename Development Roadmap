# Development Plan for Streamer's Stash System

## Introduction
This development plan outlines the stages, tasks, and order of operations for the development of the Streamer's Stash System. Its purpose is to provide clarity and direction, ensuring the project stays on track and critical components are addressed.

---

## Phase 1: Setup and Environment Configuration

### 1. Setup Development Environment
- Install necessary software: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Node.js, React Native, etc.
- Set up a virtual environment for Python.

### 2. Initialize Repositories
- Create a Git repository for the project.
- Setup `.gitignore` for Python, Django, React, and React Native.

### 3. Database Configuration
- Install PostgreSQL.
- Set up the initial database schema.
- Configure Django to connect to PostgreSQL.

---

## Phase 2: Backend Development

### 1. Basic Django Project Setup
- Start a new Django project using `django-admin startproject`.
- Set up initial apps using `python manage.py startapp` for `inventory`, `analytics`, `users`.
- Configure initial URLs and settings.

### 2. Develop Models
- In the `inventory` app:
  - Define the primary `Item` model with fields: Name, ASIN, URL, Current Price, Location, Status, Date of Purchase, Warranty Info.
  - Consider setting up signals or utility functions for automatic price updates.
  - Migrate the database using `python manage.py migrate`.

### 3. Setup Amazon Product Advertising API
- Familiarize yourself with the API documentation.
- Implement necessary API calls with the Python `requests` library or a relevant SDK.
- Consider error-handling mechanisms for rate limits or data inconsistencies.

### 4. Develop Controllers and Logic
- Set up views (controllers) for CRUD operations in `inventory`:
  - Create a new item.
  - Update existing item details.
  - Delete an item.
  - Retrieve a list or single item details.
- Implement logic to fetch trending or on-sale items from Amazon.

### 5. Setup Authentication
- Integrate Django's built-in authentication or consider Django Rest Framework (DRF) for more robust API-based authentication.
- Set up user registration, login, and logout views.
- Implement token-based or session-based authentication.

### 6. Develop API Endpoints
- Using Django or DRF, define API endpoints:
  - CRUD endpoints for `inventory`.
  - Endpoints for Amazon analytics.

---

## Phase 3: Frontend Development (Web)

### 1. Setup React Project
- Initialize the project using `create-react-app` or other boilerplates.
- Set up routing using libraries like `react-router-dom`.

### 2. Develop Components
- Design and implement primary views:
  - Dashboard view displaying a list of items and analytics.
  - Detailed item view.
  - CRUD forms for item management.
  - Analytics dashboard to show trending items or on-sale items.
  
### 3. Connect to Backend
- Set up state management using Context API, Redux, or MobX.
- Use `axios` or `fetch` to connect to the backend:
  - Handle CRUD operations.
  - Fetch data from the analytics endpoints.
- Implement error-handling for API calls.

### 4. Styling and Responsiveness
- Integrate a CSS framework such as Bootstrap or Material-UI.
- Ensure all components are mobile-responsive.
- Apply consistent theming and styling throughout.

---

## Phase 4: Mobile Development

### 1. Setup React Native Project
- Initialize the project.

### 2. Develop Mobile Components
- Components optimized for mobile.

### 3. Integrate with Backend
- Ensure endpoints are suitable for mobile.

---

## Phase 5: Testing

### 1. Backend Testing
- Set up testing tools and libraries like `pytest` for Django.
- Write unit tests for models (database operations, methods).
- Write tests for views (API endpoints).
- Use Postman or similar tools to manually test the API for expected and edge cases.

### 2. Frontend Testing
- Use tools like `Jest` and `React Testing Library` for unit tests.
- Test the rendering and interaction of components.
- Test async operations, like data fetching.
- Consider end-to-end tests using tools like `Cypress`.

### 3. Mobile Testing
- Use both Android and iOS emulators for React Native app testing.
- Perform manual testing on actual devices.
- Test user flows, interactions, and visual design on different screen sizes.

---

## Phase 6: Deployment and Documentation

### 1. Backend Deployment
- Choose a hosting platform.
- Deploy the Django backend.

### 2. Frontend Deployment
- Host the frontend.

### 3. Documentation
- Write a comprehensive guide on setup, usage, etc.
- Update the README.md with final details.

### 4. Gather Feedback and Iterate
- Collect user feedback.
- Make improvements based on feedback.

## Conclusion
This development plan is intended to serve as a guide. Adjustments may be needed based on new requirements, challenges, or feedback. Development is iterative; it's crucial to remain adaptive and revisit the plan as necessary.
